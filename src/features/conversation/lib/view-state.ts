//     first AGENT_STATE_CHANGED event (i.e. Ada hasn't started greeting yet)
//   - `idle`: Ada has been active and is now quiet — safe for the user to speak

// There is no `ended` state: the end-call button unmounts the conversation tree and
// returns to the landing screen. Anything that would have rendered for "ended" (Call
// ended pill, Start new call CTA) lives on the landing page instead.
